# landuse_germany
High resolution land use data for Germany

The dataset shows land use in Germany based on 38 basic land use classes with very high resolution of 2.5 metres pixel size. The data is processed in the framework of the Monitor of Settlement and Open Space Development being a Research Data Infrastructure of the Leibniz Institute of Ecologial and Regioal Development in Dresden. The employed land use categorisation is oriented at the "Actual Use" object class of the Authoritative Topographic-Cartographic Information System (ATKIS) of the mapping agencies of the German federal states. Therefore, it is a blend of pure land use and land cover nomenclatures. 

The dataset is derived and processed from the Digital Basic Landscape Model (ATKIS Basic DLM) being the most accurate and up-to-date topographical geo-database covering the whole terrestrial earth surface of Germany. Digital topographical objets are assigned to the defined land-use classes according to theie object types and specific attribute values. Linearly modelled features including the road and railway networks and rivers are buffered according to their object widthes in order to gaining the actual areal dimensions. The land-use features are finally stored as a integer raster dataset with the values coding the land-use categories.
